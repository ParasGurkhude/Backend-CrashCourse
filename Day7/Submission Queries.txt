1. List all databases present in your MongoDB server:
=> show dbs 

2. Create or switch to a database in MongoDB:
=> use yourDatabaseName

3. Create a collection named "students" in your MongoDB database:
=> db.createCollection("students") 

4. Insert a single document into the "students" collection with at least three fields: name, age, and course:
=> db.students.insertOne({ name: "John Doe", age: 21, course: "Computer Science" })

5. Insert multiple documents into the "students" collection in a single command:
=>  db.students.insertMany([
        { name: "Jane Smith", age: 22, course: "Mathematics" },
        { name: "Alice Brown", age: 23, course: "Physics" },
        { name: "Bob Johnson", age: 24, course: "Chemistry" }
    ]) 

6. Find or read all documents in the "students" collection:
=> db.students.find()
    
7. Read or find the first document in the "students" collection:
=> db.students.findOne()
    
8. Update the course field of a specific student named "John Doe" to "Data Science":
=> db.students.updateOne({ name: "John Doe" },{ $set: { course: "Data Science" } })

9. Increment the age field of all documents in the "students" collection by 1:
=> db.students.updateMany({},{ $inc: { age: 1 } })

10. Delete a document with a specific name from the "students" collection:
=> db.students.deleteOne({ name: "John Doe" }) 

11. Delete all documents from the "students" collection where the age is greater than or equal to a specific value:
=> db.students.deleteMany({ age: { $gte: specificValue } }) 

12. Find documents in the "students" collection where the course field is "Data Science":
=> db.students.find({ course: "Data Science" })
